* General

  This is an AVR8 bootloader that was derived from [[http://www.roland-riegel.de/boofa/][Roland Riegel's BOOFA code]] by [[https://github.com/wexi/amforth-shadow][Enoch from AmForth-Shadow]]. It is GPLv2 licensed.

* Set-up

  Make sure that this bootloader fits the smallest 1KB boot size. Set Fuse High Byte to BOOTSZ1=1, BOOTSZ0=1, BOOTRST=1. Tailor boof_config.asm and Makefile to suit your application.  Here BOOFA is
  invoked if a TP5-TP6 link is detected (RED LED OFF) or when application code is missing (RED LED ON). The GREEN LED is initially ON.
