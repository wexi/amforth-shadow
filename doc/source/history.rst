5.4.2013: release 5.1
.....................

* core: Automatic scoping of words. A system hook can be used to
  use a different wordlist than CURRENT to place a new word in.
  Thanks to Enoch for the idea and the code.
* lib: very flexible CRC8 checksum generator and checker. Thanks to Enoch.
* recipes: :ref:`Interrupt Critical Section`, :ref:`Unbreakable`,
  :ref:`Efficient Bitmanipulation`, :ref:`Dump Utilities`, :ref:`Ctrl-C`
  Thanks to Enoch and the others on the mailling list for code and inspiration.
* core: :command:`-int` does no longer leave the SREG register. It
  only turns off the global interrupt flag. Thanks to Enoch.
* lib: major 1-wire enhancements: CRC checks and a better naming
  convention for all words. Thanks to Erich for help and substantial
  contributions.
* appl: added the Arduino Leonardo. avrdude needs a small patch to
  write properly the eeprom on the Atmega32U4.
* core: New :command:`popcnt` (n -- m) counts the
  `Hamming Weight <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight>`_
  of the given number.
* core: renamed :command:`baud` to :command:`ubrr`.
* core: :command:`nfa>lfa` is a factor in a number of words. It
  generates the link field address from a given name field address.
* doc: Farewell docbook XML, welcome reST. All documentation will
  be written in `reStructured Text <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.
* lib: Simple Quotations. Their typical use case is

.. code-block:: forth

   : foo ... [: bar baz ;] ... ;

which is equivalent to

.. code-block:: forth

   :noname bar baz ; Constant#temp#
   : foo ... #temp# ...;

27.12.2012: release 5.0
.......................

* lib: Access to :ref:`1-Wire`.
  Based on code and ideas by Bradford J. Rodriguez for the
  `4â‚¬4th project <http://www.4e4th.eu>`_.
* lib: many Arduino ports have more than one purpose. The forth200x
  `Synonym <http://www.forth200x.org/synonym.html>`_
  gives them useful alias names.</a>
* Arduino: Added definitions for all ports based upon :ref:`Digital Ports`.
* recipes: There are now more than 30 :ref:`Cookbook` in the cookbook: many
  debug tools, loop with timeout, porting from C, and interrupts to mention some of them.
* core: autogenerate :command:`sleep` depending on register availability.
  :command:`sleep` on an Atmega32 is very different from an Atmega328p. The parameters for
  calling it at the forth level are the same however. The include list for the assembler
  is expanded with :file:`core/<device>/` to find the right :file:`sleep.asm` file.
* core: rudimentary error checks in the compiler: There has to be branch destination
  on the stack. If there is nothing, a stack underflow exception gets thrown.

.. code-block:: forth

      > : ?do i . loop ;
      ?? -4 14
      > : t2 ?do i . loop ;
       ok
      >

* core: Number sign may follow the number base prefix as specified in
  `Forth200x Number Prefix <http://www.forth200x.org/number-prefixes.html>`_.
  Added the character # as prefix for decimal as well.
* core: fixed a regression in :command:`toupper` caused by making :command:`within`
  standards compliant. Thanks to Arthur for the fix. :command:`[compile]` fixed as well.


27.7.2012: release 4.9
......................

* core: initialisation of the USER area is now done in WARM. please check your TURNKEY to remove
  the call to it. Thanks to Erich for pointing to.
* core: regenerated the devices files with the part description files from studio v6.
  added bitnames to the forth and python modules (later to be used with the shell).
* tools: completly new shell program with cool upload features from Keith:
  `amforth-shell <http://amforth.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/amforth/trunk/tools/amforth-shell.py?view=log>`_
  It has command completion, full command history, automatic controller identification with
  all register names and much more. Updated the :ref:`Upload` for this task
* lib: re-arranged source files, improved timer modules.
* lib: :command:`case` did not work at all. Thanks to Jan for telling.
* core: the new variable :command:`latest` has the XT of the currently being defined
  colon word.
* core: :command:`unused` should tell the free amount of memory in the area :command:`here`
  points to: RAM. Thanks to Carsten for the hint.
* core: introducing an environment query for basic controller information: memory sizes,
  max dictionary address: :command:`mcu-info`. The structure itself is not yet finalized.
  See at the end of a
  `core/<device>/device.asm <http://amforth.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/amforth/trunk/core/devices/atmega328/device.asm?view=markup>`_
  file for details.
* tools: The upload utilities were unable to process absolute filenames (those beginning
  with a /) Thanks to Carsten for the fix.

26.3.2012: release 4.8
......................
* core: fixed a bug in :command:`na@` and :command:`nb@` (extended VM registers).
* core: redesigned :command:`to` for use in LOCALs and RAM-based values.
* core: :command:`.s` is stripped down to a single line output of the stack content only.
  Looks better in the call tracer and is more like other forth's.
* core: small atxmega updates. Unfortunatly avrdude cannot flash the boot loader
  section as expected.
* core: optional Unified memory address space. :command:`@` and :command:`!` use the
  range from 0 to RAMEND as RAM, from RAMEND+1 upwards the next addresses from EEPROM,
  until EEPROMEND is reached and the remaining addresses from flash.
* core: :command:`environment?` can now be used in colon definitions. changed into
  loadable forth source instead of compile-time assembly.
* core: :command:`itype` now sends proper (e.g. single byte) characters to
  :command:`emit`.
* core: :command:`type` is made more robust against :command:`emit` errors.
* lib: :command:`macro` and a :ref:`Defining and using Macros` recipe
  for using them.
* :ref:`Profiler` to count the number of calls.
* lib: :command:`evaluate` for both RAM and Flash based strings.


4.2.2012: release 4.7
.....................

* recipes: :ref:`Multitasking`, :ref:`Reason For Reset` and :ref:`Tracer`
* core: new words from the STRINGS word set: :command:`sliteral` and
  :command:`compare`. Latter is a simplified version of the ANS94 spec:
  max 255 chars, (in)equality tests only.
* core: :command:`source`, :command:`refill` are now deferred words, based on the USER area. :command:`>in`
  likewise. Based on ideas from `Strong Forth <http://home.vrweb.de/stephan.becher/forth/doc/chapter11.htm>`_.
* core: :command:`/key` removed, it can be implemented by changing :command:`refill`.
* lib: The multitasker could not work after power cycles. Thanks to Erich for fixing.

6.10.2011: release 4.6
......................

* core: :command:`words` shows the *first* entry in the search order list as
  specified by DPANS94.
* lib: new word :command:`m*/` (d1 n1 n2 -- d2), uses a triple cell intermediate for d1*n1.
* lib: new words :command:`bm-set`, :command:`bm-clear` and :command:`bm-toggle` that
  efficiently change bits in RAM byte addresses. e.g. :command:` %0010 here bm-toggle` changes
  bit 2 in the RAM location at :command:`here`.
* lib: renamed :command:`spirw` to :command:`c!@spi`, new word :command:`!@spi`
  exchanges two bytes via SPI. Follows remotly the memory access word naming conventions.

29.6.2011: release 4.5
......................

* arduino: re-arranged word placing to maximize usable flash (at least on a duemilanove device, the bigger
  variants like the sanguino and mega* still have room for improvement). The target mega is now called mega128.
* lib: :file:`lib/buffer.frt`  implements  `buffer: <http://www.forth200x.org/buffer.html>`_.
* doc: improved refcard. Thanks to Erich for input and patches.

  to the final addr/len pairs. Do not use counted strings any longer!
* core: new words :command:`find-name` and :command:`parse-name` follow
  `Forth 200x <http://www.forth200x.org/parse-name.html>`__
  and operate on the current input buffer, :command:`word` is no longer used internally. Lots of internal code simplifications.
* core: :command:`(create)` throws exception -16 if no name is given.
* core: exception -42 is really -4 (stack underflow).
* core: :command:`digit?` again. Stack effect now compatible to gforth: :command:`( char -- n true | false)`.
  Current setting of :command:`base` is now taken internally.

24.5.2011: release 4.4
......................

* examples: added a game of life and a queens puzzle solver.
* core: restructure of the RAM usage. You need to remove the :command:`.set here = ...` line from your
  application definition file (template.asm).

  high level initialization.
* doc: updated Technical Documentation of Recognizers and Interrupt Processing. Reformatted the
  :ref:`RefCard` to a more compact style.
* core: added :command:`n>r` and :command:`nr>` from `Forth 200x <http://www.forth200x.org/n-to-r.html>`__.
* core: Redesign of Interrupt Handling. ISR Routines are still normal Colon Words and
  can deal with every kind of interupts. There are no lost interupts any longer. Based on
  Ideas from Wojciech (Tracker ID 2781547) and Al (mailling list).
* appl: Fixed a regression in the floating point library due to changes in :command:`number` in post 4.0 releases.
  :command:`>float` can now be used as the main part of a recognizer.

1.7.2010: release 4.0
.....................

* tools: amforth-upload.py optionally loads a device specific module and replaces
  register definitions with their values prior to sent the code to the controller.
  The device modules are auto-generated from the part description files.
* core: ANS94 mention that HERE points to the data (RAM) region. Re-introduced DP
  as the dictionary (Flash) pointer. :command:`HEAP` is gone. Migrate old HEAP to
  HERE and old HERE to DP.

  files to include :file:`device.asm` instead of the device name. Set the include directory
  to the proper subdirectory under :file:`core/devices` as well.
* core: dynamically calculate the free space. Do not use all of it however, the data stack may grow.

.. code-block:: forth
