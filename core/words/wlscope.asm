; wlscope, "wordlist scope" ( addr len -- addr' len' wid ), is a deferred word
; which enables the AmForth application to choose the wordlist ( wid ) for the
; new voc entry based on the input ( addr len ) string. The name of the new voc
; entry ( addr' len' ) may be different from the input string. Note that all
; created voc entry types pass through the wlscope mechanism. The default
; wlscope action passes the input string to the output without modification and
; uses get-current to select the wid.
