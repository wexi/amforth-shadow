<h2>Recognizers</h2>

Recognizers are not a new concept for forth. They have been
discussed earlier.

The goal of a recognizer is to extent the Forth command interpreter
dynamically and make it understand and handle new data 
formats as well as new synatax's. The preset recognizers 
achieve this by generalizing the classic interpreter and 
introducing an API to factor the components. Recognizers 
are portable across different forth's.

The papers linked below give some background information and
describe the concept. Example code is in the code base.
