# AmForth-Shadow

AmForth-Shadow is a [Forth system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29) that is optimized for
[Atmel AVR microcontrollers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR).  AmForth-Shadow is an **independent** fork of [AmForth](http://amforth.sourceforge.net/) ever since the
latter changed its license from GPLv2 to GPLv3. See:
