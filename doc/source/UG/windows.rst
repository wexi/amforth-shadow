Document contributed to the amforth project on SourceForge.net.


Introduction
------------

This manual describes the amforth programming language and provides
details on how to customize the standard release for use on your target
platform.  This document focuses on developing amforth applications in
the Windows environment, using Atmel's freeware AVRStudio4.  For
information on developing amforth applications in the Linux/Unix
environment, consult the Web.

amforth is a variant of the ans94 Forth language, designed for the AVR
ATmega family of  microcontrollers (MCUs).  amforth v2.3 was developed
and maintained by Matthias Trute; the amforth project is hosted and
maintained on SourceForge.net (http://sourceforge.net/projects/amforth).

You create your amforth application by creating a custom template file,
(optionally) modifying some of the files included in the distribution
set, assembling them with AVRStudio4, then moving the resulting object
file into flash in the target hardware.  Your amforth application
resides in flash, using very little RAM or EEPROM.

amforth is fully interactive.  You can connect your target hardware to a
serial port on your host PC, run a comm program such as Hyperterm, and
develop additional Forth words and applications on the target.  Each
word you create interactively is also stored in flash and is available
following reset or power-cycle of the target.  You can select one of
your amforth words to be the boot task, which will run automatically on
the next reset or power-cycle.  You can also write interrupt service
routines (ISRs) in amforth for handling low-level, time-critical events.

This manual assumes familiarity with Atmel's AVRStudio4 development
suite (Windows OS); some knowledge of AVR assembly language programming
is helpful but not necessary for basic use of the amforth language.  You
can download the free AVRStudio4 suite from Atmel
(http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725).  You
can use version 4.2 or higher; note that you need to fill out a fairly
simple registration page to complete the download.

This manual also assumes a working knowledge of the Forth programming
language.   If you are new to Forth, or if you need a quick refresher or
a reference page, you can find a full Web version of Leo Brodie's
marvelous book, “Starting Forth,” online at
http://home.iae.nl/users/mhx/sf.html.

About this document
-------------------

I created this document to support Matthias' work on amforth.  He has
designed an excellent Forth that I enjoy using, but I thought newcomers
to amforth could use a bit more detailed explanation on setting up an
application.  As my contribution to his amforth project, I'm providing
this user's manual.

This document was written using OpenOffice version 3.2.0.  You can
download a copy of OpenOffice at the project's website:
www.openoffice.org

I have contributed this document to Matthias for inclusion in his
project, with the hope that others will edit and expand this text, to
make amforth even better.  If you modify this document, please include
this section (with suitable additions) and include my name in the list
of contributors.

A quick look inside amforth
---------------------------

amforth v4.2 is available as a single downloadable file
(:file:`amforth-4.2.zip`).  Download this file into your working folder (I'll
use :file:`c:\\projects\\amforth-4.2` throughout this document) and unzip them,
preserving the subdirectory structure.  You should end up with the
following subdirectory layout:

.. code-block:: none

 c:\projects\amforth-4.2\              <-- main directory, holds your project files
                      \appl            <-- holds amforth systems for various MCUs
                      \core            <-- holds source for amforth primitives
                      \doc             <-- holds amforth documentation
                      \examples        <-- holds small projects written in amforth
                      \lib             <-- holds libraries of Forth source files
                      \tools           <-- holds amforth support tools (pd2amforth)

You will develop your custom applications by creating simple assembly
language source files in the main directory, assembling your source
files and the amforth source files with AVRStudio4, then downloading the
resulting .hex and .eep files into your target with AVRStudio4.

Note that although you will be creating assembly language source files,
the files will be little more than a few macro invocations.  Generally,
you will not need to know any AVR assembly language to develop your
applications.

The following sections describe the various subdirectories and files
found in the initial installation of amforth.


:file:`core\\words` subdirectory
................................

The :file:`core\\words` subdirectory holds a large collection of amforth words,
each defined in a separate :file:`.asm` file.  Each file in this subdirectory is
a complete word definition, ready to assemble into the final
application.    For example, here is the entire contents of equal.asm,
the source file for the word :command:`=`, which compares two values on the top of
the stack and leaves behind a flag that is TRUE if the values match or
FALSE if they don't.

.. code-block:: none

 ; ( n1 n2 -- flag ) Compare
 ; R( -- )
 ; compares two values
 VE_EQUAL:
    .dw $ff01
    .db "=",0
    .dw VE_HEAD
    .set VE_HEAD = VE_EQUAL
 XT_EQUAL:
    .dw PFA_EQUAL
 PFA_EQUAL:
    ld temp2, Y+
    ld temp3, Y+
    cp tosl, temp2
    cpc tosh, temp3
 PFA_EQUALDONE:
    brne PFA_ZERO1
    rjmp PFA_TRUE1

This source file gives an excellent view of the layout for each amforth
word.  It isn't necessary that you understand how a word is laid out
inside the dictionary in order to use amforth.  However, if you ever
need to define your own amforth words, you will need to follow the
layout shown here to make sure your words properly integrate into the
dictionary.



:file:`core\\devices` subdirectory
..................................

The :file:`core\\devices` subdirectory holds several folders, each defining a
target MCU.  For each target MCU defined, the associated folder holds
four files..

The :file:`device.asm` file is intended to be included as part of your
application, and provides assembly language definitions for MCU-specific
parameters, such as where RAM starts, the number and layout of the
interrupt vectors, and where high flash memory starts.

The :file:`<target>.frt` file contains Forth source defining MCU-specific
parameters, such as IO register names and addresses.  You can use this
file when working in Forth on your target system; it is not needed when
building an amforth system in AVRStudio4.

The :file:`device.inc` file contains assembler source and  is intended to be
included as part of any amforth applications you build for the target
device.  This file creates Forth words in your dictionary that provide
access to the MCU registers on your target.

(Comments on device.py file are needed.)

If you need to develop support files for a different Atmel MCU, you can
copy the existing files for a similar device and use these copies as a
starting point for your efforts.  Rename the files to match the target
MCU, then refer to the appropriate Atmel reference manual to determine
the proper values for the various registers and parameters.  Where
possible, ensure that the assembly language names for the ports match
those in the existing :file:`.asm` file.  If the names do not match, or if you
need to add new names to provide support for a new subsystem (such as
the CANBus ports on an AT90CAN128), you may need to edit one or more
existing amforth source files.

(Add details on how the device.py file is generated.)


:file:`core\\amforth.asm`
.........................

:file:`amforth.asm` contains a small amount of assembly language source that:
* defines the Forth inner interpreter,
* declares the starting address of the Forth kernel,
* allocates the memory for the final system,
* sets up the small area of EEPROM used by the Forth system,
* declares the interrupt service routine (ISR) support,
* adds the words to be assembled into low flash memory (:file:`dict_appl.inc`),
* adds the words to be assembled into high flash memory (:file:`dict_appl_core..inc`)

The :file:`amforth.asm` included in your original download is essentially
complete, in that when assembled it will create most of an amforth
system.  However, key information about the target hardware is missing
and must be supplied by you in what is known as a template file.
Details on what this template file contains and how you use the template
file to describe your target hardware are contained in a later section.

Note that :file:`amforth.asm` refers to a turnkey application (see
XT_APPLTURNKEY in the `.eseg` segment).    This execution token is assumed
to be an amforth word defined somewhere in your application.  The
default turnkey application, defined in the file :file:`applturnkey.asm`,
provides a typical Forth interactive environment.  You can customize
:file:`applturnkey.asm` as needed; see the section below on :file:`applturnkey.asm`.



:file:`core\\dict_core.inc`
...........................

This file lists all amforth words that will be included in that part of
amforth's dictionary stored in high flash memory (also known as the
bootloader area or NRWW flash).  The following excerpt from the standard
:file:`dict_core.inc` file shows how the file fits into the amforth system.

.. code-block:: none

 ; this part of the dictionay has to fit into the nrww flash
 ; section together with the forth inner interpreter
 .include "words/int-on.asm"
 .include "words/int-off.asm"
 .include "words/int-restore.asm"

 .include "words/exit.asm"
 .include "words/execute.asm"
 .include "words/dobranch.asm"
 .include "words/docondbranch.asm"

 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 .include "words/doliteral.asm"
 .include "words/dovariable.asm"
 .include "words/doconstant.asm"
 .include "words/douser.asm"
 .include "words/fetch.asm"
 .include "words/store.asm"
 .include "words/cstore.asm"
 .include "words/cfetch.asm"

Each line in :file:`dict_core.inc` is either a comment or an `.include` statement
that adds an assembly language source file from the :file:`words/` folder.
Thus, the words listed in this file and the order in which they appear
define the high-memory portion of  your amforth project dictionary.

In general, the words in dict_core.inc provide flash read and write
capability, though other primitives, such as branch operations and the
inner interpreter, may also be included.  The amforth design puts these
flash read/write operations in high flash memory because the AVR MCU
does not allow instructions in one area of flash memory to modify that
same area of flash memory.  Putting the flash read/write primitives in
high flash memory allows amforth words in low flash memory to use these
primitives to modify the dictionary, which is kept in low flash.

The amount of high flash memory varies based on the type of AVR device.
Some small devices may have so little high flash memory that you won't
be able to fit all of the words in this file into the available memory.
Should this happen, you may be able to move some of the `.include`
statements from this file into :file:`dict_minimum.inc` (see below).  Note,
however, that this must be done carefully, to keep the flash read/write
words (at least) in high flash memory.

For nearly all applications, you can simply leave :file:`dict_core.inc`
unchanged.


:file:`core\\dict_minimum.inc`
..............................

This file was called :file:`dict_low.inc` in previous versions of amforth.  Like
:file:`dict_core.inc`, it contains a series of .include statements that add a
list of core amforth words to the final system.

The words included in :file:`dict_minimum.inc` are stored in the target system
in low flash memory.  The entire dictionary in low flash memory that is
created when you build an amforth system becomes your application's
dictionary.  The last word in :file:`dict_minimum.inc` will be the last word
created in your application, assuming you don't add any other words as
you build your application.

You could, if you chose, edit :file:`dict_minimum.inc` to change the order or
content of your application's dictionary.  However, this really should
be avoided.  Instead, use :file:`dict_minimum.inc` as provided and add your own
custom `.include` file that defines your application.  That file, named
:file:`dict_appl.inc`, is discussed below.


Developing your own amforth system
----------------------------------

The following sections describe the files you need to create for
building your own amforth system.  In general, these are the only files
you will need to edit during development.  You can often find suitable
files already in the distribution that can serve as starting points for
these files; just copy and edit them to make your own files.

:file:`dict_appl.inc`
.....................

The file :file:`dict_appl.inc` is created by you and contains those amforth
words that you want to add to your application above and beyond the
words added by :file:`dict_minimum.inc` and :file:`dict_core.inc`.

You create your own :file:`dict_appl.inc` file using a standard text editor,
such as AVRStudio4's text editor. Here is a simple :file:`dict_appl.inc` file
that I use for creating a typical amforth development system.  It
provides words for printing unsigned numbers, listing the dictionary,
and displaying parts of memory.

Here is the :file:`dict_appl.inc` file I created for my sample amforth system.

.. code-block:: none

 ; this dictionary contains optional words
 ; they may be moved to the core dictionary if needed

 .include "dict_minimum.inc"				; <-- required!
 .include "words/fill.asm"
 .include "words/d-2star.asm"
 .include "words/d-plus.asm"
 .include "words/d-minus.asm"
 .include "words/d-invert.asm"
 .include "words/udot.asm"
 .include "words/dot-s.asm"

 .include "words/dotstring.asm"
 .include "words/squote.asm"

 .include "words/words.asm"

 .include "words/edefer.asm"
 .include "words/rdefer.asm"
 .include "words/is.asm"

 .include "applturnkey.asm"
 .include "words/int-store.asm"
 .include "words/1ms.asm"
 .include "words/ms.asm"

 .include "dict_compiler.inc"
 .include "words/show-wordlist.asm"
 .include "devices/atmega328p/device.inc"		; <-- hard-coded path!
 .include "dict_usart.inc"


Note that the first statement in my file includes the :file:`dict_minimum.inc`
file.  Note also that I have hard-coded the path to the appropriate
:file:`device.inc` file.  If you build your application for a different MCU, you
will need to adjust this path.

You are free to include whatever words from the :file:`words/` folder you want
in your application.  Note that if you accidentally include a duplicate
word, assembling the resulting application will generate an error; you
will need to edit out the duplicate word and reassemble.

:file:`dict_appl_core.inc`
..........................

The file :file:`dict_appl.inc` is created by you and contains those amforth
words that you want to add to your application above and beyond the
words added by :file:`dict_minimum.inc` and :file:`dict_core.inc`.  The difference
between this file and :file:`dict_appl.inc` above is the words in this file will
be written to high flash (the NRWW or bootloader section).

Because of the limited amount of space in the NRWW sections of most
ATmega devices, you will want to limit the words in this file to those
absolutely required to support amforth.  In general, these are words
that modify flash, such as istore.asm.  Below is the :file:`dict_appl_core.inc`
file for my sample amforth system.

.. code-block:: none

	.include "dict_core.inc"				; <-- required!
	.include "words/estore.asm"
	.include "words/efetch.asm"

	.include "words/istore.asm"
	.include "words/istore_nrww.asm"
	.include "words/ifetch.asm"

Note that my file starts by including the :file:`dict_core.inc` file.  You can
add additional words in your :file:`dict_appl_core.inc`, subject to space
limitations in your MCU.  If you accidentally include words already
included by other segments of the amforth system, you will get assembler
errors for the duplicates; just remove the duplicates from your
:file:`dict_appl_core.inc` file.



:file:`applturnkey.asm`
.......................

This file is created by you and contains the assembly language source
for a turnkey application, as called out in the file amforth.asm (see
appropriate section above).

The file :file:`applturnkey.asm` usually contains amforth words, written in
assembly language, in the form shown in the :file:`words/` subdirectory
description above.

The following sample :file:`applturnkey.asm` file shows the default turnkey
application.  This application is suitable for most amforth systems and
should be included when you build your system.  Here is the
:file:`applturnkey.asm` file for my sample amforth system.

.. code-block:: none

 ; ( -- ) System
 ; R( -- )
 ; application specific turnkey action
 VE_APPLTURNKEY:
    .dw $ff0b
    .db "applturnkey",0
    .dw VE_HEAD
    .set VE_HEAD = VE_APPLTURNKEY
 XT_APPLTURNKEY:
    .dw DO_COLON
 PFA_APPLTURNKEY:
    .dw XT_INITUSER
    .dw XT_USART
    .dw XT_INTON
    .dw XT_CR
    .dw XT_CR
    .dw XT_VER
    .dw XT_CR
    .dw XT_SLITERAL
    .dw 22
    .db "Karl's amForth system "
    .dw XT_ITYPE

    .dw XT_EXIT

The above simple application initializes the user area and `USART0`,
displays amforth's version information on the serial terminal, displays
an extra message proclaiming this as my amforth system, then exits to
the main amforth shell.

Note that my custom message ends with a space.  I did this so the
message had an even number of letters.  If the string length is odd, the
assembler reports a warning that it had to add an zero-byte to pad out
an even number of bytes.  (I could have also used the ,0 technique shown
in the declaration of the applturnkey string at the top of the file.)




The template file
.................

You define the characteristics of your target hardware and your
application in a template file.  The template file is an assembly
language source file you create with a standard ASCII text editor, such
as AVRStudio4's text editor.  Although this is called an assembly
language source file, you will typically not write any true assembly
language instructions.  Instead, the contents of your template file will
largely consist of `.include` and `.equ` statements.

Here is the template file, :file:`myproj.asm`, for defining my sample amforth
system running on an Atmega328P MCU with a clock frequency of 16 MHz.

.. code-block:: none

 ;
 ;  myproj.asm      a simple AVRStudio4 assembly-language project for amforth
 ;
 ;
 ; The order of the entries (esp the include order) must not be
 ; changed since it is very important that the settings are in the
 ; right order
 ;
 ; first is to include the macros from the amforth
 ; directory
 .include "macros.asm"

 ; include the amforth device definition file. These
 ; files include the *def.inc from atmel internally.
 .include "devices/atmega328p/device.asm"		; <-- hard-coded path!

 ; amforth needs two essential parameters
 ; cpu clock in hertz, 1MHz is factory default
 .equ F_CPU = 16000000

 ; terminal settings
 .set WANT_ISR_RX = 1 ; interrupt driven receive
 .set WANT_ISR_TX = 0 ; send slowly but with less code space

 ; initial baud rate of terminal
 .include "drivers/usart_0.asm"
 .equ BAUD = 38400

 .if WANT_ISR_RX == 1
  .set USART_B_VALUE = (1<<TXEN0) | (1<<RXEN0)| (1<<RXCIE0)
 .else
  .set USART_B_VALUE = (1<<TXEN0) | (1<<RXEN0)
 .endif

 .equ USART_C_VALUE = (3<<UCSZ00)

 .equ TIBSIZE  = $64    ; ANS94 needs at least 80 characters per line
 .equ APPUSERSIZE = 10  ; size of application specific user area in bytes

 ; addresses of various data segments
 .set here = ramstart           ; start address of HERE, grows upward
 .set rstackstart = RAMEND      ; start address of return stack, grows downward
 .set stackstart  = RAMEND - 80 ; start address of data stack, grows downward
 .equ amforth_interpreter = max_dict_addr ; the same value as NRWW_START_ADDR
 ; change only if you know what to you do
 .equ NUMWORDLISTS = 8 ; number of word lists in the searh order, at least 8

 .equ want_fun = 1 ; in case of an error out print an additional line with an caret indicating the error position

 ; include the whole source tree.
 .include "amforth.asm"


Your template file must include the file :file:`macros.asm`, and this should be
the first statement (except for comments, of course) in your template
file.  The file :file:`macros.asm` contains a set of macros specific to amforth,
used to simplify the coding of the amforth words and underlying assembly
language routines.

Next, your template file should include the :file:`device.asm` file specific to
your target hardware.  This file is found in the :file:`core\\devices\\<target>`
folder that matches your target hardware.  Note that in the above
sample, the path to the :file:`device.asm` file is hard-coded in the `.include`
statement.  If you are using a different MCU, you will need to edit this
`.include` statement.

Next, your template file should declare a key equate required by
amforth.  The equate `F_CPU` defines the oscillator frequency, in Hertz,
of your target hardware and is expressed as a long integer.  The example
shown above shows the target system uses an 16 MHz clock; F_CPU is
declared as 16000000.

Next, you need to set a couple of equates defining how your target
hardware will use USART0.  As shown, my amforth system will use receive
interrupts for incoming characters ( `WANT_ISR_RX = 1`) but will poll when
sending characters (`WANT_ISR_TX = 0`).  For your first system, leave
these as defined.  After you get more skilled in amforth, you can change
these equates to tweak performance.

Next, your template file should include the assembly source file
supporting the USART you intend to use as a console on your target
hardware.  The example above uses USART0 and includes the appropriate
device include file.  The equates BAUD, USART_B_VALUE, and USART_C_VALUE
defines the characteristics of the USART that will ultimately serve as
the console on your target hardware.  You may need to alter these values
in your own template file to match your target.

In general, the remaining equate values (`.equ` and `.set`) in the template
file will be calculated automatically, based on previously defined
values in the Atmel definition files for the various MCUs.

This completes the custom portion of the template file.  All that
remains is the final include statement, which basically adds all of the
words that make up the standard amforth system.  Everything you would
need to do for the majority of amforth systems can be done with the
statements available to you in your template file.

Setting up AVRStudio4
---------------------

Begin by creating a new assembly-language project in AVRStudio4.  For my
sample, I named this project myproj and created it in the
:file:`c:\\projects\\amforth-4.2` folder.

I then created the four above files in my project folder (the folder
holding :file:`myproj.aps`).

Next, I added the path to the :file:`core\\` folder to my project.  To do this,
click on Project/Assembler Options and locate the entry for Additional
include path.  Enter in this field the full path to the core\ folder; in
my case, this path is :file:`C:\\projects\\amforth-4.2\\core`.

This completes setup in AVRStudio4.  Pressing F7 assembles the source
files and leaves behind two object files.  The file :file:`myproj.hex` contains
the flash contents for my amforth system and the file :file:`myproj.eep` holds
the EEPROM values needed at startup.

I then hooked my programming pod (an AVRISP mkII) to the target board
and applied power.  I first made sure that the device's fuses were
properly set.  In particular, I checked that the bootloader area was set
to the maximum (2048 words for the ATmega328P), the EESAVE fuse was
checked, and the fuse for BOOTRST (jump to bootloader on reset) was NOT
checked.

Finally, I downloaded the EEPROM file to the target, followed by
downloading the flash file.  When I reset the target, the Hyperterm
window hooked to the target's serial port showed the expected amforth
announcement.  My amforth system was up and running!

What could go wrong?
--------------------

When you build a properly created amforth system, you should not get any
errors or warnings.  If the assembler complains about not finding
included files, double-check the layout of your amforth folder; it
should match what I've described at the beginning of this manual.
Additionally, make sure you entered the path to your :file:`core\\` folder
correctly in the Additional include path box when you set up the
project's properties.

If the project builds properly but does not provide characters to your
serial port when you download your code to the target, double-check that
your Hyperterm settings match those in your template file (:file:`myproj.asm`
above).  Also confirm that you got the MCU frequency correct in your
template file.  Also double-check that you put the correct hard-coded
paths in your template file and in your :file:`dict_appl.inc` file.  Also make
sure you download BOTH the `.hex` and the `.eep` files for your project, and
that you have the EESAVE fuse on your device checked.


An alternative AVRStudio4 setup
-------------------------------

The above method uses two hard-coded paths in your source files.  This
can cause problems if you later  try to change processors; it's easy to
forget to change one of the hard-coded paths and it can take time to
track down the error.

As an alternative, you can go to Project/Assembler Options and remove
the path you added in the Additional include path field.  Edit the
Additional parameters field to include the following text, all entered
on a single line::

 -I C:\projects\amforth-4.2\core -I C:\projects\amforth-4.2\core\devices\atmega328p

Note that the above entry is for my project; adjust as needed for your
file paths and target MCU.  Be sure to include the single space after
each `-I` as shown!

With this change in place, you can now remove the hard-coded paths in
your template file and your :file:`dict_appl.inc` file.  For example, in my
:file:`myproj.asm` template file above, I had the line::

 .include "devices/atmega328p/device.asm"		; <-- hard-coded path!

After adding the above change to the  Additional parameters field, this line becomes::

	.include "device.asm"

Make a similar change in :file:`dict_appl.inc` and reassemble.
