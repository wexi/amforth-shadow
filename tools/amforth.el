;; Changes by anton
;; This is a variant of forth.el that came with TILE.
;; I left most of this stuff untouched and made just a few changes for 
;; the things I use (mainly indentation and syntax tables).
;; So there is still a lot of work to do to adapt this to gforth.

;; Changes by David
;; Added a syntax-hilighting engine, rewrote auto-indentation engine.
;; Added support for block files.
;; Replaced forth-process code with comint-based implementation.

;; Tested with Emacs 19.34, 20.5, 21 and XEmacs 21

`forth-hilight-level' to zero.")

  "*Non-nil means to parse Forth-code just-in-time.

in Emacs21 (and newer versions).")

(defvar forth-words nil 
  "List of words for hilighting and recognition of parsed text areas. 

Hilighting of object-oriented Forth code is achieved, by appending either
`forth-objects-words' or `forth-oof-words' to the list, depending on the values of `forth-use-objects' or `forth-use-oof'.

After `forth-words' changed, `forth-compile-words' must be called to
make the changes take effect.

Each item of `forth-words' has the form 
   (MATCHER TYPE HILIGHT . &optional PARSED-TEXT ...)

MATCHER is either a list of strings to match, or a REGEXP.
   If it's a REGEXP, it should not be surrounded by '\\<' or '\\>', since 
   that'll be done automatically by the search routines.

TYPE should be one of 'definiton-starter', 'definition-ender', 'compile-only',
   'immediate' or 'non-immediate'. Those information are required to determine
   whether a word actually parses (and whether that parsed text needs to be
   hilighted).

HILIGHT is a cons cell of the form (FACE . MINIMUM-LEVEL)
   Where MINIMUM-LEVEL specifies the minimum value of `forth-hilight-level',
   that's required for matching text to be hilighted.

PARSED-TEXT specifies whether and how a word parses following text. You can
   specify as many subsequent PARSED-TEXT as you wish, but that shouldn't be
   necessary very often. It has the following form:
   (DELIM-REGEXP SKIP-LEADING-FLAG PARSED-TYPE HILIGHT)

DELIM-REGEXP is a regular expression that should match strings of length 1,
   which are delimiters for the parsed text.

A non-nil value for PARSE-LEADING-FLAG means, that leading delimiter strings
   before parsed text should be skipped. This is the parsing behaviour of the
   Forth word WORD. Set it to t for name-parsing words, nil for comments and
   strings.

PARSED-TYPE specifies what kind of text is parsed. It should be on of 'name',
   'string' or 'comment'.")

INDENT1 specifies how to indent a word that's located at the beginning

INDENT2 specifies how to indent words that are not located at the

INDENT1 and INDENT2 are indentation specifications of the form

Major mode for editing Forth code. Tab indents for Forth code. Comments

stream source format. See also `forth-block-mode'.
\\{forth-mode-map}

Variables controlling syntax hilighting/recognition of parsed text:
 `forth-words'
    List of words that have a special parsing behaviour and/or should be
    hilighted. Add custom words by setting forth-custom-words in your
    .emacs, or by setting forth-local-words, in source-files' local 
    variables lists.
 forth-use-objects
    Set this variable to non-nil in your .emacs, or in a local variables 
    list, to hilight and recognize the words from the \"Objects\" package 
    for object-oriented programming.
 forth-use-oof
    Same as above, just for the \"OOF\" package.
 forth-custom-words
    List of custom Forth words to prepend to `forth-words'. Should be set
    in your .emacs.
 forth-local-words
    List of words to prepend to `forth-words', whenever a forth-mode
    buffer is created. That variable should be set by Forth sources, using
    a local variables list at the end of file, to get file-specific
    hilighting.
    0 [IF]
       Local Variables: ... 
       forth-local-words: ...
       End:
    [THEN]
 forth-hilight-level
    Controls how much syntax hilighting is done. Should be in the range 
    0..3

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `forth-indent-words'
    List of words that influence indentation.
 forth-local-indent-words
    List of words to prepend to `forth-indent-words', similar to 
    forth-local-words. Should be used for specifying file-specific 
    indentation, using a local variables list.
 forth-custom-indent-words
    List of words to prepend to `forth-indent-words'. Should be set in your
    .emacs.    
 forth-indent-level
    Indentation increment/decrement of Forth statements.
 forth-minor-indent-level
    Minor indentation increment/decrement of Forth statemens.

Variables controlling block-file editing:
 forth-show-screen
    Non-nil means, that the start of the current screen is marked by an
    overlay arrow, and screen numbers are displayed in the mode line.
    This variable is by default nil for `forth-mode' and t for 
    `forth-block-mode'.
 forth-overlay-arrow-string
    String to display as the overlay arrow, when `forth-show-screen' is t.
    Setting this variable to nil disables the overlay arrow.
 forth-block-base
    Screen number of the first block in a block file. Defaults to 1.
 forth-warn-long-lines
    Non-nil means that a warning message is displayed whenever you edit or
    move over a line that is longer than 64 characters (the maximum line
    length that can be stored into a block file). This variable defaults to
    t for `forth-block-mode' and to nil for `forth-mode'.

Variables controlling interaction with the Forth-process (also see
`run-forth'):
  forth-program-name
    Program invoked by the `run-forth' command (including arguments).
  inferior-forth-mode-hook
    Hook for customising inferior-forth-mode.
  forth-compile-command
    Default command to execute on `compile'.

Another problem is imposed by block files that contain newline or tab 
characters. When Emacs converts such files back to block file format, 
it'll translate those characters to a number of spaces. However, when
you read such a file, a warning message is displayed in the echo area,
